                <a href="./recipes/salmon.html"><img class="photo" src="./images/receta1.png" alt="first_recipe"></a>
                <p>this recipe for baked salmon with citrus and ginger sauce is a good proof of the many possibilities that these two ingredients have. the sweet and sour of the citrus and the slight spiciness of the ginger, the sauce is insane and the flavor of the fish is simply exquisite.</p>

                <p>Perhaps it is one of the most emblematic dishes among those considered exotic. The mix of spices in the curry, the chicken and usually the rice as a garnish please even the less fond of trying new things.</p>
