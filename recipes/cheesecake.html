        <h3>preparation</h3>

        <p>If you already saw the ingredients, you can already imagine that we are going to use ginger in all the layers of this cake. For the base we will use gingerbread cookies. We can use the typical Christmas gingerbread men. We crush them and mix them with the butter previously melted in the microwave.</p>

        <p>Once the mixture of butter and ground biscuits is made, we distribute it in the oven-proof mold that we are going to use, forming a layer half a cm high. To make it compact, press down with the back of a spoon.</p>

        <p>In a bowl we mix the ingredients of the filling, that is, the eggs, the sugar, the liquid cream and the cream cheese, without beating them excessively, simply leaving them well distributed. Once mixed, grate the ginger (1 cm is enough) and distribute it in the mixture. If you think of other similar cheesecakes, the one we use is lemon zest.</p>

        <p>Once mixed, pour it over the gingerbread cookie base and bake for 25-30 minutes at 160ยบ, turning off the oven when the cake is still a little raw in the center and letting it cool in the oven with the door ajar. This is how a juicy cheesecake remains. When cool, unmold and decorate with the currant jam and a slice of ginger cut into sticks.</p>
