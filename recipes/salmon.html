        <p>We will start by preheating the oven to 200ยบ with heat up and down. Place the cleaned and seasoned salmon loins in a baking dish lined with non-stick paper and reserve.</p>

        <p>In a small saucepan, add the juice from one of the grapefruits and the orange juice, as well as the maple syrup and grated fresh ginger. We put everything to heat until it boils. Once it boils, lower the heat and cook for 15 minutes until a kind of syrup is formed. Off the heat add the butter and reserve.</p>
