# odin-recipes
this is my first project in odin project.

What I seek to achieve with this project is to design a web page with an elegant design where formality and subtlety stand out. In this, emphasis will be placed on different food recipes, indicating the necessary ingredients and the steps to follow to prepare the dish.

The skills to demonstrate are:

*create lists
*add images to page
*use of different headers
*creation and links between pages
*implementation of the taught labels
